# Logical Gates:
A *logic gate* is device that performs a Boolean function, logical operation performed on one or more binary inputs that produces a single binary output [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate).

## Basic Logic Gates:
>1. `NOT` Gate (Inverter)
- Inverts the inputs,
- Symbol: A triangle with a small circle (representing inversion) at its output.
>2. `AND` Gate:
- Outputs true (1) only if both inputs are true,
- Symbol: A flat-ended shape.
>3. `OR` Gate:
- Outputs true if at least one input is true,
- Symbol: A curved shape pointing to the output.

## Derived Gates:
>1. `NAND` Gate:
- Outputs the inverse of the `AND` gate,
- Symbol: `AND` + o at the end.
>2. `NOR` Gate:
- Outputs the inverse of the `OR` gate,
- Symbol: `OR` + o at the end.
>3. `XOR` Gate (Exclusive `OR`):
- Outputs true if and only if one one of the inputs is true,
- Symbol: `OR` + parallel initial line of the `OR` gate.
>4. `XNOR` Gate (Exclusive `NOR`):
- The inverse of `XOR`; outputs true if both inputs are the same,
- Symbol: `XOR` + o at the end
