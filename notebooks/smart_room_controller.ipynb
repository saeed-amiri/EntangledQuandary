    "# Smart Room Controller (with a Door Sensor)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead just controlling the light (smart_light_controller_v1), here we extend the logic both the light and the fan using a simple door sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario:\n",
    "1. **Presence Sensor ($A$):** 1 if someone is detected, 0 otherwise,\n",
    "2. **Ambient Light Sensor ($B$):** 1 if bright, 0 otherwise,\n",
    "3. **Door Sensor ($C$):** 1 if the door is **open**,  and 0 if the door is **closed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Desired Behavior:\n",
    "- The light should turn on if someone is present and if it is dark,\n",
    "- The **fan** should turn on only if the **door is closed** and **someone is present.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Circuit Design:\n",
    "1. **Light ($L$):** Turn on when someone is present, and it is dark:\n",
    "                $$L = A \\cdot \\overline{B}$$\n",
    "2. **Fan ($F$):** Turns on when someone is present, and the the door is closed:\n",
    "                $$F = A \\cdot \\overline{C}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "* $\\overline{B}$ is NOT of $B$,\n",
    "* $\\overline{C}$ is NOT of $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Meaning:\n",
    "* The Light still follows our previous logic.\n",
    "* The Fan should not run if the door is open (to save energy and prevent air loss).\n",
    "* In real electronics:\n",
    "    - The NOT Gate inverts sensor readings.\n",
    "    - The AND Gate ensures correct conditions.\n",
    "    - Transistors or Relays control real devices.\n",
