    "## Overview\n",
    "A **subtractor** is a combinational circuit that performs subtraction of two binary numbers. It takes two binary inputs and produces the difference as output. The basic operation of a subtractor is to find the difference between two binary numbers, similar to how an adder finds the sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Half Subtractor Overview\n",
    "It is analogous to a half adder but preforms binary subtraction instead of additions. It takes two bits and produce two outputs: the **difference** and **borrow**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inputs:\n",
    "    - **A**: The number to subtract from (minuend),\n",
    "    - **B**: The number to subtract (subtrahend).\n",
    "* Outputs:\n",
    "    - **Difference (D)**: The result of subtracting B from A without considering a borrow from a previous digit,\n",
    "    - **Borrow (Bout)**: indicate if there is a need to borrow a more significant bit (it is 1 when A is less than B).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logic of Half Subtractor\n",
    "1. **D**: The difference out put is given by XOR of A and B:\n",
    "        $$D = A \\oplus B$$\n",
    "    - If A and B are the same, D is 0,\n",
    "    - if A and B differ, D is 1.\n",
    "2. **Bout**: The borrow output is generated when A is 0 and B is 1. This can be expressed as:\n",
    "        $$\\text{Bout} = \\bar{A} \\cdot B$$\n",
    "    - $\\bar{A}$ (NOT A) is 1 when A is 0,\n",
    "    - Thus, when A is 0 and B is 1, Bout is 1; otherwise, it is 0.\n",
