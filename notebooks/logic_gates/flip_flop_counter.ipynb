    "### Flip-Flop:\n",
    "*\"In electronics, flip-flops and latches are circuits that have two stable states that can store state information – a bistable multivibrator [[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics))].\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clock Signal:\n",
    "*\"In electronics and especially synchronous digital circuits, a clock signal (historically also known as logic beat) is an electronic logic signal (voltage or current) which oscillates between a high and a low state at a constant frequency and is used like a metronome to synchronize actions of digital circuits. In a synchronous logic circuit, the most common type of digital circuit, the clock signal is applied to all storage devices, flip-flops and latches, and causes them all to change state simultaneously, preventing race conditions [[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_signal)].\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Synchronous Circuit:\n",
    "*\"In digital electronics, a synchronous circuit is a digital circuit in which the changes in the state of memory elements are synchronized by a clock signal. In a sequential digital logic circuit, data is stored in memory devices called flip-flops or latches. The output of a flip-flop is constant until a pulse is applied to its \"clock\" input, upon which the input of the flip-flop is latched into its output. In a synchronous logic circuit, an electronic oscillator called the clock generates a string (sequence) of pulses, the \"clock signal\". This clock signal is applied to every storage element, so in an ideal synchronous circuit, every change in the logical levels of its storage components is simultaneous. Ideally, the input to each storage element has reached its final value before the next clock occurs, so the behaviour of the whole circuit can be predicted exactly. Practically, some delay is required for each logical operation, resulting in a maximum speed limitations at which each synchronous system can run [[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_circuit)]. \"*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Asynchronous Circuit:\n",
    "*\"Asynchronous circuit (clockless or self-timed circuit) is a sequential digital logic circuit that does not use a global clock circuit or signal generator to synchronize its components. The asynchronous circuits do not need a global clock, and the state of the circuit changes as soon as the inputs change. The local functional blocks may be still employed but the clock skew problem still can be tolerated. Since asynchronous circuits do not have to wait for a clock pulse to begin processing inputs, they can operate faster. Their speed is theoretically limited only by the propagation delays of the logic gates and other elements[[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_circuit)].\"*"
