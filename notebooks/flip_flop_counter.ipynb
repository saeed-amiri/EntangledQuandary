    "## What is a Counter in Digital Logic:\n",
    "A **counter** is a circuit that **increments** or **decrements** a stored value each time an event happens (e.g., a button press, a clock pulse, etc.).\n",
    "* It **remembers a number** using **flip-flops**,\n",
    "* Each time a signal (like a button press) occurs, the count **increases (or decreases)**.\n",
    "* It built using **T or JK Flip-Flops**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Does a Counter Work Using Flip-Flops?\n",
    "Counters are made by **counting flip=flops together**, where:\n",
    "1. The **output of one flip-flop** becomes the **input to the next flip-flop**,\n",
    "2. Each **flip-flop stores 1 bit** of the count,\n",
    "3. The **number stored doubles as we add more flip-flops** (Binary Counting).\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **1-bit counter** can count: **0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1** (Toggles ON/OFF),\n",
    "- A **2-bit counter** can count: **00 -> 01 -> 10 -> 11 -> 00 -> ..**,\n",
    "- A **3-bit counter** can count: **000 -> 001 -> 010 -> 011 -> 100 -> ..**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Counters:\n",
    "### 1. Asynchronous (Ripple) Counter\n",
    "* Flip-flops **trigger one after another** (not all at the same time),\n",
    "* The **output of one flip-flop** acts as the **clock input** to the next one,\n",
    "* **Slower but simple**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Synchronous Counter\n",
    "* **All** flip-flops are triggered **at the same time** by the same clock,\n",
    "* **Faster and more reliable** than asynchronous counters,\n",
    "* Requires **extra logic gates** to ensure synchronized toggling.\n",

    "### How It Works:\n",
    "1. The **first flip-flop (FF1)** toggles every time clock signal **goes HIGH (1)**,\n",
    "2. The **second flip-flop (FF2)** toggles every time **FF1 goes from 1 -> 0**.\n",
